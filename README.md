# Testing Without Mocks: Complex Example

Readme TBD


Running the Code
----------------

To run the code in this repository, install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org). Make sure you have version 16.15.1. If you have a different version of Node, the code will probably work, but you may experience some unexpected test failures. If that happens, make sure you have the correct version of Node installed.

* To run the build and automated tests, run `.\watch.cmd quick` (Windows) or `./watch.sh quick` (Mac/Linux) from the root directory of the repo. The build will automatically re-run every time you change a file.

* The build only runs tests for files that have changed. Sometimes it can get confused. Restarting the script is usually enough. To make it start from scratch, run `.\clean.cmd` (Windows) or `./clean.sh` (Mac/Linux).

* To run the servers, run `.\serve_dev.cmd 5010 5011` (Windows) or `./serve_dev 5010 5011` (Mac/Linux) from the root directory of the repo. Then visit `http://localhost:5010` in a browser. The server will automatically restart every time you change a file.

*Note:* The `watch` script plays sounds when it runs. (One sound for success, another for lint failure, and a third for test failure.) If this bothers you, you can delete or rename the files in `build/sounds`.


How the Servers Work
--------------------

Start the servers using the serve command described above. E.g., `./serve_dev.sh 5010 5011`. This starts two servers: a WWW server on port 5010 and a ROT-13 service on port 5011.


### The WWW server

The WWW server serves HTML to the user. Access it from a web browser. For example, `http://localhost:5010`. The server will serve a form that allows you to encode text using ROT-13. Enter text into the text field and press the "Transform" button. Behind the scenes, the browser will send a "text" form field to the WWW server, which will send it to the ROT-13 service and serve the result back to the browser.


### The ROT-13 service

The ROT-13 service transforms text using ROT-13 encoding. In other words, `hello` becomes `uryyb`.

The service has one endpoint:

* **URL**: `/rot13/transform`
* Method: `POST`
* Headers:
	* `content-type: application/json`
* Body: JSON object containing one field:
  * `text` the text to transform
  * E.g., `{ "text": "hello" }`
* Success Response:
	* Status: 200 OK
	* Headers: `content-type: application/json`
	* Body: JSON object containing one field:
		* `transformed` the transformed text
		* E.g., `{ "transformed": "uryyb" }`
* Failure Response
	* Status: 4xx (depending on nature of error)
	* Headers: `content-type: application/json`
	* Body: JSON object containing one field:
		* `error` the error
		* E.g., `{ "error": "invalid content-type header" }`

You can make requests to the service directly using your favorite HTTP client. For example, [httpie](https://httpie.org/):

```sh
~ % http post :5011/rot13/transform content-type:application/json text=hello -v
POST /rot13/transform HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json, */*;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 17
Host: localhost:5011
User-Agent: HTTPie/2.1.0
content-type: application/json

{
    "text": "hello"
}

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 23
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Tue, 30 Jun 2020 01:14:15 GMT

{
    "transformed": "uryyb"
}
```


Finding Your Way Around
-----------------------

You don't need to know the ins-and-outs of the codebase to do the exercises. But in case you want to know more:

Branches:

* `dev`: Used by James Shore for work in progress.
* `exercise1`: **Challenges demonstrating how to use nullable infrastructure wrappers to test glue code.**
* `exercise2`: **Challenges demonstrating how to create nullable infrastructure wrappers from scratch.**
* `integration`: **The completed code.**
* `part1`: Same as `exercise1`. Allows you to start the exercise again.
* `part2`: Same as `exercise2`. Allows you to start the exercise again.

Top-level directories and files:

* `build/`: Scripts for running the build, the servers, etc.
* `generated/`: Files generated by the build.
* `node_modules/`: Third-party modules from npm, such as Mocha (the test framework) and Chai (the assertion library)
* `src/`: **Source code**
* `build.cmd` and `build.sh`: Run the build and exit. Use the `quick` option to only build files that have changed. Use the `-T` option to see other build targets.
* `clean.cmd` and `clean.sh`: **Reset the incremental build.**
* `integrate.sh`: Merge the `dev` branch into the `integration` branch (only for use by James Shore)
* `LICENSE.txt`: Copyright and license.
* `package.json` and `package-lock.json`: Generated by `npm` (the Node package manager).
* `README.md`: This file.
* `serve_dev.cmd` and `serve_dev.sh`: **Start the servers and automatically restart when files change.** Takes two port numbers. The first is the port of the WWW server; the second is the port of the ROT-13 service.
* `watch.cmd` and `watch.sh`: **Automatically re-run the build every time a file changes.** Uses the same options as `build`.

`src/`:

* `node_modules/`: **Code shared by both servers.** Note that these are *not* third-party modules from npm.
* `rot13_service/`: **Code for the ROT-13 service.**
* `www/`: **Code for the user-facing web server.**
* `_all_servers_test.js`: Unit tests for `all_servers.js`.
* `_server_node_test.js`: Unit tests for `server_node.js`.
* `_smoke_test.js`: End-to-end integration test.
* `all_servers.js:` **Application start-up code.**
* `serve.js:` Entry point for the application (just runs all_servers.js).
* `server_node.js` Base class for both servers.

`src/node_modules/`:

* `http/`: HTTP infrastructure
* `infrastructure/`: Other infrastructure
* `util/`: Utility modules

`src/node_modules/http/`:

* `_*_test.js`: Unit and narrow integration tests.
* `generic_router.js`: A general-purpose router than can be configured to convert URL paths to method calls.

* `_*_test.js`: Unit tests.
* `assert.js`: A thin wrapper around Chai (an assertion library). Contains some extra assertions.
* `ensure.js`: A run-time assertion library meant for use in production code. `ensure.signature()` is particularly useful for run-time type checking.
* `infrastructure_helper.js`: Useful functions for infrastructure wrappers. Only contains `trackOutput()` at present.

## About the Patterns

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate the [Testing Without Mocks patterns](https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/projects/testing-without-mocks/testing-without-mocks). Here are each of the patterns in the article and how they're used in this code:


### Foundational Patterns

#### [Narrow Tests](https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/projects/testing-without-mocks/testing-without-mocks#narrow-tests)


#### [State-Based Tests](https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/projects/testing-without-mocks/testing-without-mocks#state-based-tests)

_all_servers_test.js, all_servers.js (wwwRouter, rot13Router)


#### [Overlapping Sociable Tests](https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/projects/testing-without-mocks/testing-without-mocks#sociable-tests)



#### [Smoke Tests](https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/projects/testing-without-mocks/testing-without-mocks#smoke-tests)



#### [Zero-Impact Instantiation](https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/projects/testing-without-mocks/testing-without-mocks#zero-impact)


#### [Parameterless Instantiation](https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/projects/testing-without-mocks/testing-without-mocks#instantiation)

WwwConfig.createTestInstance()

Every class can be instantiated without providing any parameters.

#### [Signature Shielding](https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/projects/testing-without-mocks/testing-without-mocks#sig-shielding)


#### [Collaborator-Based Isolation](https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/projects/testing-without-mocks/testing-without-mocks#isolation)

_all_servers_test.js




### Architectural Patterns

#### [A-Frame Architecture](https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/projects/testing-without-mocks/testing-without-mocks#a-frame-arch)


#### [Logic Sandwich](https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/projects/testing-without-mocks/testing-without-mocks#logic-sandwich)


#### [Traffic Cop](https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/projects/testing-without-mocks/testing-without-mocks#traffic-cop)


#### [Grow Evolutionary Seeds](https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/projects/testing-without-mocks/testing-without-mocks#grow-seeds)

The code was built evolutionarily. You can get a sense of how it evolved by looking at the commit history.


### Logic Patterns

#### [Easily-Visible Behavior](https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/projects/testing-without-mocks/testing-without-mocks#visible-behavior)

The `rot13` encoding function, `transform()`, is a pure function.

#### [Testable Libraries](https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/projects/testing-without-mocks/testing-without-mocks#testable-libraries)

This program doesn’t use any third-party logic libraries.


### Infrastructure Patterns

#### [Infrastructure Wrappers](https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/projects/testing-without-mocks/testing-without-mocks#infrastructure-wrappers)


#### [Narrow Integration Tests](https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/projects/testing-without-mocks/testing-without-mocks#narrow-integration-tests)


#### [Paranoic Telemetry](https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/projects/testing-without-mocks/testing-without-mocks#paranoic-telemetry)



### Nullability Patterns

#### [Nullables](https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/projects/testing-without-mocks/testing-without-mocks#nullables)


#### [Embedded Stub](https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/projects/testing-without-mocks/testing-without-mocks#embedded-stub)


#### [Thin Wrapper](https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/projects/testing-without-mocks/testing-without-mocks#thin-wrapper)

The code is written in JavaScript, so Thin Wrappers aren't needed.

#### [Configurable Responses](https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/projects/testing-without-mocks/testing-without-mocks#configurable-responses)


#### [Output Tracking](https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/projects/testing-without-mocks/testing-without-mocks#output-tracking)


#### [Behavior Simulation](https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/projects/testing-without-mocks/testing-without-mocks#behavior-simulation)

This code doesn’t respond to events from external systems, so Behavior Simulation isn't needed.

#### [Fake It Once You Make It](https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/projects/testing-without-mocks/testing-without-mocks#fake-it)


### Legacy Code Patterns

The code was a green-field project, so the legacy code patterns weren't needed.
